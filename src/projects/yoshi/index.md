Yoshi Hair was developed as a school project for Project Management Course. My goal was creating a briefing upon an in-person meeting with a client, finding out the goals of the website, it's target audience, the style and services it must include. After that I had to develop the of the branding of the company, UX/UI and finally code the website and deploy it.
