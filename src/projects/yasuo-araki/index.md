*** Project Still Under Development ***

Yasuo Araki Gallery is a Vancouver-based art gallery featuring the works of Yasuo Araki. I've used Wordpress as the backend for artworks gallery and blogs posts, and React.JS to build the frontend, through the Wordpress Restful API. Project still being optimized before going into production.
