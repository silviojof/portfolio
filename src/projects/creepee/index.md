Creep.ee's owner is a guy passionate about "Creepy Pasta". He follows several blog and websites devoted to the theme and even contribute to some of them as a writer. So he decided to have his own, tailored to his like, and invited me to develop the brand and the website. As he is used to work on Wordpress for other projects, we opted to use that CMS for this one.
